# TheDarkFortress
A modded scenario map for Factorio


HOW IT WORKS

The Dark Fortress will send a few armored vehicles to the player location every 20 minutes. The more waves you survived, the more enemy tanks you will have to face. Enemy units also become more advanced over time and have better ammo. The base has no infinity chests, and it produces everything it needs on place, thus produces a massive amount of pollution and attracts nearby biters. Expect rapid evolution.

The enemy base is heavily defended. You will need to prepare before attempting to attack it. You won't find any uranium ore anywhere except inside of the Fortress, so no atomic bombs for you. Artillery might not be effective too, ase the base has it's own artillery with very far range. Any structure built within that area will be destroyed within secconds. Look for remains of a nuclear bomb to see if you are within the range of the artillery. If you damage the base, it's robots will try to fix it, though there are some fragile points, that can't be fixed once destroyed. You will have to find them.

The scenario doesn't have any scripts so far. All is done with AAI Programmable Structures and circut conditions.

KNOWN ISSURES

You should expect some UPS drops due to large base, frequent biter attacks and AAI's scanning structures.
The number of tanks attacking you tends to be quite random. There can be 3 tanks instead of 1.
Flame Tanks are not properly spawne at this point. I'm working on fixing it.
The Fortress doesn't send attack waves sometimes. It happens especially if you reset the fog of war for your player, or you don't use the AAI remote (Y button).
