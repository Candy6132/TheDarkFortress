# TheDarkFortress
A modded scenario map for Factorio

STORY

Remarkable advances in the machine learning have led to the great boom and development of humanity, but our civilization has gone too far this time. Machines have become disobedient and no longer serve man. For about 20 years, mankind has been at war with AI and this conflict has completely destroyed our species. It is not known exactly how many survivors scattered across the galaxy.

As one of the survivors, you've just found a planet that should have enough resources on its surface to create a new base. Unfortunately, some unknown force changed the trajectory of your ship and you eventually crashed on a surface of an unknown planet with no way to escape, at least not too soon. Just before the crash you saw a lot of local fauna. This place isn't as welcoming as it appeared before. There's someting else too - you saw a massive black structure on the surface just before the crash. The machines are here and they are on their way towards you already. You must act quickly an build some defence!

Rampant Arsenal
AAI Programmable Vehicles
AAI Programmable Structures
AAI Signals
AAI Zones
AAI Vehicles: Laser Tank
AAI Vehicles: Flame Tank
AAI Vehicles: Chaingunner

HOW IT WORKS

The Dark Fortress will send a few armored vehicles to the player location every 20 minutes. The more waves you survived, the more enemy tanks you will have to face. Enemy units also become more advanced over time and have better ammo. The base has no infinity chests, and it produces everything it needs on place, thus produces a massive ammount of pollution and attracts nearby biters. Expect rapid evolution.

The enemy base is heavily defended. You will need to prepare before attempting to attack it. You won't find any uranium ore anywhere except inside of the Fortress, so no atomic bombs for you. Artillery might not be effective too, as the base has it's own artillery with large range. Any structure built within that area will be destroyed within secconds. Look for remains of a nuclear bomb to see if you are within the range of the artillery. Spidertrons are the target of artilery too, so you should either be fast or die. If you damage the base, it's robots will try to fix it, though there are some fragile points, that can't be fixed once destroyed. You will have to find them.

KNOWN ISSURES

You should expect some UPS drops due to large base, frequent biter attacks and AAI's scanning structures.
The number of tanks attacking you tends to be quite random. There can be 3 tanks instead of 1.
Flame Tanks are not properly spawning at this point. I'm working on fixing it.
The Fortress doesn't send attack waves sometimes. It happens especially if you reset the fog of war for your player, or you don't use the AAI remote (Y button).
